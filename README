Dinospeak
=========

Dinospeak is a library to encode human language to dinosaur language.
You know, in case they come back to life or invade us using dino spaceships.

Dinospeak is optimized for small strings (eg. micro-blogging) and aims in
preserving punctuation.

Source code repo: https://bitbucket.org/glezos/dinospeak


Installing
==========

You can install using the standard ``setuptools``::

  (sudo) easy_install dinospeak

With sudo, dinospeak will be installed eg. in
``/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/dinospeak-0.x-py2.6.egg/``.

The current implementation depends on smaz_. The above command should
install it automatically for you.

  hg clone https://bitbucket.org/glezos/dinospeak
